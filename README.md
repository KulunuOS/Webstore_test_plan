### Test plan

The repository contains a utility library that is being used by the front-end of an E-commerce store application. A test plan is being prepared by considering wider aspects of testing. Specifically following questions are being addressed.

- What functions of the utility library should be tested? and how are they tested?
- Does it require integrating testing / interface testing, performance testing?
- What are end-to-end common use cases of the app? How to validate them using tests?
- How to document the test results
- A template for issue and bug reports

A total of 10 functions from the utility library has to be selected for testing. The Following is a list of all the included function with a priority analysis.
